# Community Design

Welcome to the Community Design Repo. Here you can file issues with your design requests for the community design group, find collaborators, or find design tasks to tackle. Don't forget to use the appropriate label to let people know what you're looking for!

Anyone can take (or make) a design issue!

If you'd like to join the community design group mailing list please [sign up here](http://ow.ly/WgQ9S) and watch this repo!
